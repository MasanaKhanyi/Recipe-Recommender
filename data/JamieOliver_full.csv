An Athenian yiayia with a modern sensibility and cutting humour that’s as sharp as her nose, Poly takes an inventive approach to cooking, looking out beyond Greece for many of her favourite dishes. It takes us a while to land on a classic Greek dish when discussing what her contribution to this book will be, but there’s absolutely no way I’m missing Poly out. She lives in a typical polykatoikia (apartment block) in Athens’ well-heeled Kolonaki neighbourhood and is representative of the elegant and refined yiayiades that make up a good portion of the city’s population. We settle on giouvarlakia to make together, Poly instructing me to do the jobs she least enjoys (like grating the onion) and pointedly ordering her grandson, Karolos, around, all the while amusing us with her sarcasm and wry wit. She’s a force to be dealt with but her warming giouvarlakia in this sweet tomato sauce reveal the care and love that she obviously has for her grandchildren. A true yiayia in every sense. Yiayia Poly serves her giouvarlakia with a small tipple of beer (she drinks one small glass every day), crusty bread and hunks of feta. ”

Niki is a healer. She says she’s never been to a doctor in her life and swears by the power of raw vegetables and fruit. She is a rare breed here in Greece, less obsessed with feeding me an overwhelming amount of food and more concerned about making sure she gives me the right thing to truly nourish. Seconds into our meeting, she’s passing me a beetroot, carrot and apple juice she’s made. Then Marco the pony makes
an entrance, helping himself to the basket of apples on the floor. Petting him and calling him ‘Markaki’, Niki doesn’t seem to mind one bit and I feel like I’ve walked into a scene from a 1990s children’s TV show. We eat Niki’s flavour-rich dish in the dappled shade of her balcony, overlooking inky blue water in the distance. The currants perfectly balance the salted cod, but if you’re not a fan of salt cod, I’ve also made this recipe with cod fillets and added salt myself. I’ve also made this into a plentiful vegan dish by omitting the fish and adding an extra potato and red (bell) pepper. ”

In Korea, white cabbage is one of the most commonly used everyday vegetables and everyone loves it. When cooked, the crunchy opaque leaves, tightly nestled together, unfurl and turn translucent. The fibrous texture of the raw ingredient softens and becomes tender, unveiling the delicate vegetal nuances that cling onto the bolder flavours, delivering the comfort that eats softly on the tongue and gently on the stomach.

Slightly charred cabbages boast intensely caramelised sweetness that sits on the verge of bitterness (in a nice way) and pairs well with a warm, garlic acidity laced with smoky gochujang. Eat this with crispy fried egg on the side and with steamed rice to make it a midweek-friendly dinner. ”

Try to buy the best ingredients you can, as that’s what really helps to make this dish amazing. I’m using a flowering variety of thyme but normal thyme is fine to use. When it comes to the type of pasta, you can serve carbonara with spaghetti or linguine, but I’ve been told by Italian mammas (who I don’t argue with!) that penne is the original, so that’s what I’m using in this recipe. Before you start cooking, it’s important to get yourself a very large pan, or use a high-sided roasting tray so you can give the pasta a good toss. ”

If you grow either of these vegetables in your garden, get the kids involved in picking and shelling them, although defrosted peas and beans from the freezer will work just as well here.

It’s named after the conical-lidded pot that the stew is traditionally cooked in – the design allows steam to condense back into the dish as it cooks, to retain its juices. This vegetarian tagine doesn’t need meat for flavour – the vegetables absorb the essences of the coriander, cumin, saffron, ginger and tomato-y stock. The vegetables should be chunky so they hold their shape during the slow cooking. Serve the tagine as the Moroccans do – over some nutty-tasting couscous. ”

It was really only once I started looking after chickens that I started to get the hang of making them.

So this new way guarantees a perfectly poached pouch of egg every time. The exciting thing is that by simply tying the egg up in cling film with a few herbs you can flavour the eggs and have confidence they’re going to cook all right. ”
